# FlashSwapArbitrage
Uniswap V3 Flash Swap Arbitrage Example
This contract appears to be an implementation of a "flash swap arbitrage" strategy for the Uniswap V3 decentralized exchange. The purpose of the contract is to allow a user to trade in multiple Uniswap V3 liquidity pools (also known as "pairs") to potentially profit from price differences between the pools.

The contract takes as input a router contract (an instance of the IUniswapV3Router01 interface) and a factory contract (an instance of the UniswapV3Factory contract). The router contract is used to execute the actual trades on Uniswap V3, while the factory contract is used to get the addresses of the liquidity pools (also known as "pairs") that the contract will trade with.

Hope this is useful to you.
